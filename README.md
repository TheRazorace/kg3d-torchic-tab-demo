# Tabular Data Understanding and Enrichment with Semantic Table Annotation (Demo)

This demo showcases tabular data understanding with our semantic table annotation tool: TorchicTab (still closed-source). TorchicTab leverages data mining techniques and language model fine-tuning to semantically annotate tabular data, providing information about the column cells, types and relationships. 

In this demo, TorchicTab annotates a real airplanes dataset with Wikidata entities, identifying the corresponding airplane, airplane families and airlines found in the table. Using this information, Wikidata is queried to discover more information about airplanes and enrich the original dataset with attributes such as wingspan, plane length, height and maximum operating altitude.
